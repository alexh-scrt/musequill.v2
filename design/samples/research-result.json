Bereft of family ties and the warmth of kinship, these characters often embark on quests not just of external adventure, but also of internal identity-seeking. Their journeys often lead to the realization of hidden potentials and strengths previously unknown. A prime example is FitzChivalry Farseer from Robin Hobb's Farseer trilogy. Born as the bastard son of royalty [...] The Ally: Steadfast companions in the hero's narrative, allies provide invaluable support, camaraderie, and strength as they navigate the treacherous paths of their quest. While they might not share the limelight like the central protagonist, their roles are pivotal, often complementing the hero's strengths or compensating for their weaknesses. These characters create moments of heartfelt connection, displaying loyalty, bravery, and sacrifice, reminding both the hero and the audience of the [...] The Outcast: The outcast archetype in fantasy literature embodies the complexities of solitude, rejection, and often a unique perspective on the societies they've been estranged from. Driven away or self-exiled due to their differences, these characters possess an introspective wisdom or a distinctive set of abilities that set them apart. Elric of Melniboné, from Michael Moorcock's series, stands as a prime example. As the last emperor of a declining empire, his albinism and reliance on the",
    "Motif Examples in Literature: Use Them in Your Writing: ### 4. The Yellow Brick Road in The Wizard of Oz\n\nThe Yellow Brick Road is more than a colorful path—it’s a symbol of the journey toward self-discovery and personal growth. Dorothy’s travels along this winding road mirror her emotional and intellectual development. Each twist and turn represents challenges and lessons, making this motif a perfect vehicle for exploring the story’s larger themes of courage, friendship, and the search for identity. [...] A theme is the big idea or message of the story (e.g., the corrupting power of wealth).\n A symbol is a tangible object that represents something abstract (e.g., the green light in The Great Gatsby symbolizes Gatsby’s unreachable dreams).\n A motif is a repeated element that emphasizes the theme (e.g., repeated imagery of wealth and extravagance throughout The Great Gatsby highlights the story’s critique of the American Dream). [...] In Jane Eyre, fire and ice frequently appear to represent the protagonist’s internal struggle between passion and restraint. Fire symbolizes Jane’s fiery independence, love, and anger, while ice reflects coldness, repression, and isolation. These contrasting motifs highlight Jane’s emotional battles and the tension between desire and societal expectations. Brontë masterfully uses these elements to underscore the novel’s larger themes of love, autonomy, and moral integrity.",

    "The Importance of Magic. The Role of Fantasy in Children's…: Percy in Rick Riordan’s _Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief_ exemplifies this. He introduces himself as a troubled, autistic boy. But as the story progresses, he discovers he is a demigod endowed with special abilities. He is taken to a camp with other adolescent demigods. Readers experience Percy’s attempts to master his newfound powers, gain the approval of his peers and manage the expectations placed upon him. [...] In Lewis Carroll’s _Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland_, Alice finds herself in several absurd situations. Now think of a child in a crowded supermarket; colourful displays intended to attract the eye are telling an already curious child to pick things up; some of the packages might even say ‘try me’, but their parents are telling them to put them back down. Add in some shoppers and mood music in the background: would this situation not seem equally absurd to a child? [...] Fantasy has the amazing ability to take this a step further, reassuring a child that, even though there might be things happening to them that they may not understand, it will be okay in the end. Alice returns from Wonderland. Percy Jackson becomes the hero his birthright demands. These stories create a world that reshapes a child’s fears and doubts, telling them they can overcome them.",
    "Literary Motifs: What is a Motif in Literature?: Birds recur throughout the novel as reminders of and aspirations towards freedom. A central plight of Jane Eyre’s is her inability to find freedom in the society she lives in: both her austere childhood and her status as a woman in Victorian England restrain and shackle her. [...] Fire and ice—or, more broadly, warmth and coldness—show up frequently as opposing motifs. Jane Eyre is typically the fiery one: warm, passionate, even at times hot-headed. Many of her oppressors, on the other hand, are icy or chilling. Mr. Reed has cold and stony eyes; Mr. Rochester is at times cold towards Jane’s and others’ feelings; the novel itself begins on a cold winter’s day in Jane’s cold, loveless childhood. St. John, later in the novel, is himself associated with snow. [...] Motifs often get mistaken for themes, but the two are importantly distinct.\n\nA theme is a central, organizing idea of a piece of literature. A poem or story explores, expands upon, or challenges a theme: it is the “aboutness” of a piece of writing, beyond simple facts about “what happened.” Some examples of themes include family, man versus nature, war, justice, or love.",
    "Motif in Literature: Definition and Examples: Harper Lee’s famous novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, is a classic tale about the loss of innocence. In it, the novel’s young protagonist, Scout, encounters injustice and racial prejudice, which exposes her to the cruelty of the world. The motif of the mockingbird appears during specific moments to symbolize innocence and goodness. As a motif, the mockingbird reminds the reader of the book’s main theme.\n\nJane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë [...] A theme is a story’s overall message or meaning. It’s what guides the narrative, causes characters to act a certain way, and gives the text a deeper meaning. Themes are typically broad and conceptual. Examples of themes in literature include mortality, good versus evil, corruption, redemption, and love. [...] In short, a theme is an abstract concept that underlies the entire story. A motif is a recurring element throughout the story that points toward that theme.\n\n## Motif vs. symbol\n\nMotifs use symbolism to refer to themes, but motifs and symbols are not the same. The easiest way to remember the difference is this: Motifs must recur throughout the story; symbols can appear just once.",

First, it is crucial to integrate SEL themes seamlessly into the narrative. As highlighted by the study, the most significant predictor of positive SEL outcomes was the integration of SEL themes.
