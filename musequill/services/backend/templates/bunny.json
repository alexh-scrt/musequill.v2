        "idea": "Write a whimsical and richly imaginative children's fantasy story centered around a small but brave and curious bunny named Peter. The story should begin in a peaceful meadow where Peter lives a simple life, but soon his adventurous nature leads him beyond the safety of his home and into a mysterious, enchanted forest. The forest should be atmospheric, blending wonder and mild danger, and populated with creatures and figures drawn from Slavic mythologyâ€”including, but not limited to, Baba Yaga, Leshy, Domovoi, and Rusalka. Each encounter should serve as both a narrative milestone and a learning moment for Peter, shaping his character through themes of courage, kindness, wit, and self-discovery.",
